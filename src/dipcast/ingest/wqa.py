"""Environment Agency Water Quality Archive: the bathing-water E. coli results of
ingest.bwq, from a different EA service, and the sampler's visual algae check made
at the same visits (fetch_algae).

Why two sources: since at least 28 Sep 2026 the bathing-water service's gateway answers
GitHub's runners with HTTP 403 whatever the User-Agent, and this service does not. On
that day, of the 702 samples the bathing-water service listed for the season at the 38
inland bathing waters, it held 675 as statutory monitoring (purpose MS) with identical
counts and qualifiers, plus 9 MS samples the other service did not list. It lags: its
latest sample trailed the bathing-water service's by 3-7 days at 15 sites and 15 days at
one. Points are mapped per site in data/raw/bathing_waters_inland.json (`wqa_point`, from
scripts/map_bathing_waters_wqa.py).
