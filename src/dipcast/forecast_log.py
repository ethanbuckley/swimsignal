"""Log every forecast and score it later against what the overflows actually did.

Three DuckDB tables in the state directory:

* forecast_overflows: one row per (issue, overflow, target day, lead) with the
  raw and calibrated spill probability. These are verifiable: the live feeds
  tell us afterwards whether the overflow discharged that day.
* forecast_points: one row per (issue, target day) with the point risk shown to
  the user. Not directly verifiable without water-quality samples; kept for
  the record and for the E. coli study.
* build_runs: one row per run of the site build (from 4 Oct 2026): how many spots
  got a forecast and which company feeds returned nothing. In the same file as the
  forecast log, so it survives between CI runs the same way (service_record).

`verify_live()` scores overflow-day forecasts whose target day has passed,
using the accumulated live history, and writes verification_live.json.

Scoring rules (16 Sep 2026):

* Decision time. For each (overflow, issue day, target day) the forecast scored is
  the latest one issued by DECISION_HOUR local time on the issue day: what a
  swimmer planning the day would have seen. Issue days with no forecast by the
  cutoff are a missed deadline: counted and reported, not scored.
* Coverage. An overflow-day scores as "no spill" only if that overflow was
  observed with a known status (discharging or not) at least MIN_KNOWN_POLLS times
  that day, with no gap between observations (or between midnight and the first,
  or the last and midnight) longer than MAX_GAP_H, from a feed that looked current,
  and at least once the next day (live_coverage.parquet, written by
  ingest.live.save_live). A poll gap, an offline monitor, a stale or dead company
  feed is a missing observation, not a dry day. A feed that stamps no record
  (South West Water's: no LastUpdated, no event times) is never current, so its
  overflows are not scored. Days from before the observation masks existed
  (observations_from) are not scored and are left out of the scoring window.
  Scores under a stricter gap rule are reported alongside.
* Spills. An overflow-day is a spill if a poll saw an event that touched that day
  (latest event start to end, or to the poll time while still discharging), or saw
  the overflow discharging with no event times, which counts on the local day of
  that poll.
* Versions. Every logged forecast carries a compact version stamp (spill model,
  calibration map, E. coli model, code, weather source); scores are broken down
  by stamp so successive changes are not mixed in one table.
* Rain. Overflow-days forecast without rainfall data (p logged as 0 with
  rain_available = false) are excluded.
* E. coli. A point forecast is compared with a sample only if it was issued
  before the sample was taken; lead 0 ("same day") is reported separately from
  leads 1-4 ("in advance").
* Warnings (4 Oct 2026). Both forecasts are also counted as a warning system at
  the site's own high-risk line (SPILL_WARN_AT, ECOLI_WARN_AT): hits, misses, false
  alarms and correct quiet days, with the share a forecast of "no" every time would
  get right beside the share correct (warning_table).
