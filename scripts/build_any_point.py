"""Publish the data a page needs to forecast any clicked point, with no server (roadmap task 3).

The API forecasts a clicked point by loading the river network (113 MB on disk, about 900 MB in
memory) and tracing upstream. GitHub Pages cannot run that, so the build does the tracing here,
once per network release, and publishes what is left for the page: snap the click to a link, read
that link's upstream overflows, and do the transport arithmetic of model/transport.py with the
day's spill probabilities.

Everything is written under site/data/anypoint/:

  tiles.json           the 0.25-degree squares that have files, the scales and the versions
  overflow_ids.json    the overflows: id, name and position; every other file names an overflow
                       by its place in this list
  overflow_days.json   per overflow: spill probability by day (thousandths; null where its rain
                       cell had no data, which is the `ok` mask), the "right now" weight
                       (thousandths), live status, company, how old its rain forecast is, and
                       the low-confidence snaps
  link_index/<t>.bin   per link: number, form, name and a simplified line, packed Int32/Float32
                       (layout in `pack_link_index`), so the page can snap a click to a link
  links/<t>.json       per traced link: its length, the network length upstream of it, and its
                       upstream overflows as transport.upstream_overflows finds them, in a form
                       that gives the distance and dilution for a click anywhere along it
                       (`rows_at`); a lake link points at its lake in lakes.json
  lakes.json           the WFD lake polygons (England) and every lake an overflow reaches: its
                       inlets, each with the overflows whose water enters there (river distance
                       and dilution before the lake-area term)
  outside_england.json Wales and Scotland, widened over their estuaries, where a click gets "England
                       only" (a copy of data/raw/outside_england.json, scripts/make_outside_england.py)

A click is placed as transport._locate places it: inside or within 150 m of a WFD lake polygon it
is that lake; otherwise the nearest link within 1.5 km, or the nearest lake centreline when that
is less than twice as far; a click on a side channel near a much bigger river is traced as that
river (_adopt_main_channel, which the page applies with each link's upstream network length from
the index). River distances and dilutions then follow upstream_overflows exactly for the click's
position along the link.

The upstream lists depend on the network and on where each overflow sits on it. They are cached
in the state directory keyed by the network file's hash; when overflows are added, removed or
moved, only the links downstream of them (within config.MAX_UPSTREAM_KM) are traced again.

Rain: every overflow's cell (about 1,650) against the spots' 300. Open-Meteo stopped answering
this build after 600 locations in a minute (3 Oct 2026), so each build fetches at most
RAIN_CELLS_PER_BUILD of the oldest cells and uses cached ones up to RAIN_MAX_AGE_H old; an
overflow without either has no rain data, which the page shows as no data, as for a spot.
