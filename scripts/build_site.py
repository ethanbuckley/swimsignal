# With email alerts on, the privacy notice gains this section under Alerts, a line in its short

# What the law asks, and where this section answers it (checked 4 Oct 2026; flagged for the
# operator's approval in the PR, not checked by a lawyer):
# - UK GDPR Article 6(1)(a) and Article 7: consent as the basis, given by a clear act (the sign-up and
#   the confirmation), shown by a record (the time of confirming), and as easy to withdraw as to give
#   (one click in every email). ICO, "What is valid consent?":
#   https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/consent/what-is-valid-consent/
# - UK GDPR Articles 13 and 28: say who receives the data and why; the email service is a processor,
#   so a contract with the Article 28(3) terms is needed (Resend's DPA, part of its terms of service).
#   Articles 44-46: transfers outside the UK need safeguards (its DPA's section 6.4, the UK Addendum
#   to the EU standard contractual clauses).
# - PECR regulations 22 and 23 govern direct marketing by email. These alerts are service messages,
#   with no promotion, which the ICO says are not direct marketing ("Identify direct marketing", last
#   updated 20 August 2025:
#   https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/direct-marketing-and-privacy-and-electronic-communications/direct-marketing-guidance/identify-direct-marketing/).
